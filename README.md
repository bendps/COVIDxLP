## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic and its lock-down measures have resulted in periods of reduced human activity, known as anthropause. While this period was expected to be favorable for the marine ecosystem, due to a probable reduction of pollution, shipping traffic, industrial activity and fishing pressure, negative counterparts such as reduced fisheries surveillance could counterbalance these positive effects. Simultaneously, on-land pressure due to
human disturbance and tourism should have drastically decreased, potentially benefiting land-breeding marine
animals such as seabirds. We analyzed 11 breeding seasons of data on several biological parameters of little penguins from a popular tourist attraction at Phillip Island, Australia. We investigated the impact of anthropogenic
activities on penguin behavior during the breeding season measured by (1) distribution at sea, (2) colony attendance, (3) isotopic niche (4) chick meal mass, and (5) offspring investment against shipping traffic and number of
tourists. The 2020 lock-downs resulted in a near absence of tourists visiting the Penguin ParadeÂ®, which was otherwise visited by 800,000+ visitors on average per breeding season. However, our long-term analysis showed no
effect of the presence of visitors on little penguins' activities. Surprisingly, the anthropause did not trigger any changes in maritime traffic intensity and distribution in the region. We found inter- and intra-annual variations
for most parameters, we detected a negative effect of marine traffic on the foraging efficiency. Our results suggest
that environmental variations have a greater influence on the breeding behavior of little penguins compared to
short-term anthropause events. Our long-term dataset was key to test whether changes in anthropogenic activities affected the wildlife during the COVID-19 pandemic.
